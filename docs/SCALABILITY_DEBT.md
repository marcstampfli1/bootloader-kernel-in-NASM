# MakaOS Scalability Debt Ledger

Running log of every stub, hardcode, and fixed-size artifact introduced for
short-term progress.  For each: what's wrong at Linux-scale, and the concrete
path from "stubbed now" to "scalable later."

This is a commitment, not a wishlist.  When we ship multi-user / USB hot-plug /
multi-GPU / real session switching, every entry here must be resolved.  New
stubs added to this repo MUST be appended to this file in the same commit —
no silent shortcuts.

Format per entry:
- **What**: the stub / hardcode / fixed array.
- **Where**: file:line pointer (or file glob).
- **Scale failure**: what breaks, at what scale.
- **Target**: the correct design.
- **Blocking order**: what must be built first (kernel / libc / library) to
  unblock the real implementation.

---

## 1. libseat stub (always-grant, fixed 64-device table)

- **What**: `libseat_open_device` tracks FDs in `fd_table[64]`; `enable_seat`
  fires immediately; no revoke/session-switch semantics.
- **Where**: `userland/libseat/libseat.c`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Breaks at 65 simultaneously-open seat devices (compositor with 64+ input
    devices — not uncommon on USB-heavy setups).
  - Breaks under any multi-session scenario: fast-user-switch, remote desktop,
    kiosk mode, locked screen with handoff.
  - No revoke path — device grabs cannot be withdrawn when a privileged
    process requests them (breaks the capability-first security model in
    `SECURITY_V2.md`).
- **Target**:
  1. `fd_table` becomes a dynamically-grown radix tree or hash keyed by
     device_id. O(1) ops, no fixed ceiling.
  2. Seat lifecycle driven by the kernel capability broker (ksec v2 from
     SECURITY_V2.md): seats become capability contexts, activation/deactivation
     is a capability transition, revoke is a capability revocation that fires
     `disable_seat` immediately.
  3. `libseat_switch_session` becomes real — kernel session table lookup,
     capability transfer, DRM master handoff.
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: capability broker (ksec v2) per SECURITY_V2.md — Tier-gated on
     "stable-kernel milestone."
  2. Kernel: session table subsystem (new).
  3. libseat: rewrite as broker client.
  4. Compositor: integrate `disable_seat`/`enable_seat` for real session swaps.

---

## 2. libudev replacement (planned) — static device list

- **What**: Native libudev equivalent will return a hardcoded list of
  `/dev/input/event0` and `/dev/dri/card0`.
- **Where**: `userland/libudev/` (to be written).
- **Scale failure**:
  - USB keyboard / mouse plugged in: invisible. No hot-plug detection.
  - Multiple GPUs (iGPU + dGPU laptop, multi-GPU workstation): only card0
    seen.
  - Touchpads, tablets, gamepads: unknown.
- **Target**:
  1. Kernel: device registry subsystem (all registered drivers report name +
     class + IDs). New ioctl interface: `/dev/makadev` control fd with
     `MAKA_DEV_LIST`, `MAKA_DEV_QUERY`, `MAKA_DEV_SUBSCRIBE` opcodes.
  2. Kernel: hot-plug events via io_uring completions on the subscribe fd.
  3. libudev: thin client of `/dev/makadev`. Enumerate via `MAKA_DEV_LIST`,
     resolve sysattrs via `MAKA_DEV_QUERY`, watch changes via the subscribe fd.
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: central device registry (every driver's register path plugs in).
  2. Kernel: `/dev/makadev` control fd.
  3. Kernel: hot-plug event stream.
  4. libudev: rewrite as registry client.

---

## 3. getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED) fakes identity

- **What**: Returns `pid=getpid(), uid=0, gid=0` for any AF_UNIX socket.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/sys_socket.c:getsockopt`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Wayland compositor cannot authenticate clients — every process appears
    to be root.
  - Blocks per-app UID from SECURITY_V2.md (each app gets its own UID,
    compositor rejects wrong-UID socket connections).
  - Privilege-sensitive IPC (D-Bus resolver daemon, mentioned in SECURITY_V2)
    has no way to verify caller identity.
- **Target**:
  1. Kernel: track peer credentials on every AF_UNIX `connect` / `accept`.
     Store `(pid, uid, gid, cap_ctx)` in the unix_sock struct.
  2. Kernel: new `SYS_GETSOCKOPT` syscall dispatching `SO_PEERCRED` et al.
  3. libc: real getsockopt routes through the syscall.
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: unix_sock struct gains peer-cred fields.
  2. Kernel: SYS_GETSOCKOPT.
  3. libc: replace fake with real syscall.

---

## 4. msync / madvise / utimes / flock no-ops

- **What**: All four return 0 without doing work.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/libc.c` (msync, madvise); `userland/libc/sys_time.c`
  (utimes, lutimes); `userland/libc/sys_file.c` (flock).
- **Scale failure**:
  - `msync`: file-backed writable mmap has no way to ensure reaches disk.
    Breaks databases (sqlite, lmdb) that depend on msync for durability.
  - `madvise`: the kernel has no pressure hints — cannot reclaim evictable
    pages under memory pressure. Scale: multi-GB working sets.
  - `utimes`: `rsync`, `make`, `tar` all touch timestamps. Without real
    updates, build systems get confused by the epoch timestamps.
  - `flock`: cross-process file locks silently succeed — sqlite/lmdb/gdbm
    corrupt their DBs when concurrent writers appear.
- **Target**:
  - Kernel: SYS_MSYNC dispatching to the page-cache writeback path.
  - Kernel: SYS_MADVISE storing hints in the vma table; reclaimer honours.
  - Kernel: SYS_UTIMES updating inode atime/mtime through virtfs.
  - Kernel: SYS_FLOCK backed by an inode-keyed lock table (shared-mode uses
    a counter, exclusive-mode uses a waitqueue).
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: page-cache with writeback (required for msync anyway).
  2. Kernel: per-inode attribute storage with timestamps in the fs layer.
  3. Kernel: flock table subsystem (can use existing futex/waitqueue infra).
  4. libc: wrappers become real syscalls.

---

## 5. fontconfig `fcobjshash.h` — linear scan over 55 entries

- **What**: Replaced gperf's perfect hash with a linear `strncmp` loop.
- **Where**: generated at port time in `scripts/port-fontconfig.sh`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - O(n=55) per lookup. Called once per property during config-parse and
    once per font during query. At 10,000 fonts × 30 props = 300K lookups
    on cold cache. Not a hot path on any realistic UI, but measurable on
    cache populate.
- **Target**:
  - Install `gperf` on the host, let fontconfig's build use the real
    perfect hash.  OR: write a MakaOS-side perfect-hash generator (awk /
    python) that matches gperf's output format.
- **Blocking order**:
  - Independent.  Install gperf whenever.

---

## 6. readv / writev via aggregation buffer

- **What**: libc `readv` and `writev` allocate (stack or heap) a contiguous
  buffer, do a single read/write, then scatter back.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/unistd.c`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Extra memcpy per I/O — at 10 Gbit/s networking that's a real CPU cost.
  - Breaks atomicity guarantees for non-stream fds (wayland happens to be
    stream, so we're ok there).
  - Heap allocation on the hot path for > 4 KiB chunks.
- **Target**:
  - Kernel: `SYS_READV` / `SYS_WRITEV` — iovec passed through directly,
    kernel loops over elements atomically where the underlying fd supports
    it (AF_UNIX: yes; stream TCP: yes; datagram: batched).
  - libc: plain one-syscall wrapper.
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: SYS_READV / SYS_WRITEV.
  2. libc: replace aggregator with direct syscall.

---

## 7. mknod is ENOSYS

- **What**: `mknod(path, mode, dev)` returns -1 / ENOSYS.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/sys_stat.c`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Any port expecting to create device nodes at runtime (libudev_zero's
    create-missing-node path, custom init systems) fails.  We mitigate
    because our `/dev/*` is virtfs-populated at boot.
- **Target**:
  - Kernel: SYS_MKNOD wiring virtfs to create a node with the given
    major/minor.  Needs a device-driver registry (same infra as item 2).
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: device registry (item 2).
  2. Kernel: virtfs gains write-mode for mknod.
  3. libc: wrapper routes through SYS_MKNOD.

---

## 8. posix_memalign forwards to malloc

- **What**: Ignores requested alignment; returns whatever malloc gives.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/stdlib.c`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - libdrm / pixman / ffmpeg request 16, 32, 64-byte alignment — our malloc
    happens to return 16-aligned, so we're OK up to alignment=16.  Breaks
    at alignment=32+ (e.g. AVX-512 code requests 64).
- **Target**:
  - Rewrite malloc to track alignment per-block, or add a separate aligned
    allocator with power-of-two alignment up to page size.  Keep O(1) on
    common sizes.
- **Blocking order**:
  - Independent.  Do when the first port requests alignment > 16.

---

## 9. `fcntl(F_SETLK / F_SETLKW / F_GETLK)` returns 0

- **What**: POSIX record locks silently succeed without kernel backing.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/fcntl.c`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Same as flock (item 5) but for byte-range locks — sqlite, postgres,
    bdb all corrupt their DBs under concurrent writers.
- **Target**:
  - Kernel: inode-keyed byte-range lock table.  Same subsystem as flock
    (item 5), just finer-grained.
- **Blocking order**:
  - Part of item 5's flock table work.  One lock table, two client APIs.

---

## 10. mtdev — no protocol-A translation

- **What**: `userland/mtdev-stub/` is a pass-through.  `mtdev_get` forwards
  to `read(fd, evs, n*24)`; `mtdev_has_mt_event` always returns 1; no
  protocol A → B slot conversion happens.
- **Where**: `userland/mtdev-stub/mtdev.c`, generated by
  `scripts/port-mtdev.sh`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Works today because the kernel emits MT protocol B natively on all
    input nodes (slots + tracking_id).  If we ever add a legacy protocol-A
    touchscreen driver (pre-2011 Linux devices, some custom HID tablets),
    libinput receives unslotted finger events and mis-tracks contacts.
- **Target**:
  - Drop in upstream mtdev's ~500 LOC protocol-A→B converter when we first
    import a protocol-A-only driver.  The ABI stays identical; only the
    stub body swaps.  No libinput rebuild needed.
- **Blocking order**:
  - Independent.  Triggered by the first protocol-A input driver.

---

## 11. libinput CLI tools not built

- **What**: `port-libinput.sh` builds only `libinput.a`; the tool
  executables (`libinput-debug-events`, `libinput-record`,
  `libinput-analyze`, `libinput-measure`, `libinput-quirks`,
  `libinput-test`) are skipped.
- **Where**: `scripts/port-libinput.sh` (`build_install` uses
  `ninja libinput.a` instead of the default target).
- **Scale failure**:
  - No on-device input debugging.  `libinput-debug-events` is how everyone
    diagnoses "why isn't my touchpad tap working" in the real world.
    Without it, regressions in our evdev driver are opaque to operators.
- **Target**:
  - Add the libc surface they need: `scanf`/`fscanf` that read from stdin
    with real format parsing (today we have `vsscanf` only), `uname`
    exported from `libc.a` as a real symbol (today it is `static inline` in
    `libc.h` and invisible to sysroot consumers), `tmpfile` exercised +
    hardened, and `localtime_r` already landed.
- **Blocking order**:
  - libc additions only.  No kernel work.  Do when the first compositor
    regression forces manual input debugging.

---

## 12. udev_device_get_parent chain is shallow

- **What**: Only DRM devices synthesize a PCI parent (`0000:00:02.0`
  hardcode).  Every other synthetic device returns NULL for
  `udev_device_get_parent()`.
- **Where**: `scripts/port-libudev.sh` →
  `udev_device_get_parent_with_subsystem_devtype`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - libinput's quirk engine (`quirks.c`) walks `device->parent` chains to
    match by PCI / USB vendor:product.  Without the chain, hardware-specific
    quirks (ThinkPad TrackPoint acceleration, Apple trackpad tuning) never
    apply — input feels generic, regardless of device.
  - Likewise, `udev_prop()` fallback through the parent chain returns no
    NAME / ID_INPUT_* properties for input devices, so libinput classifies
    every device as "unknown type."
- **Target**:
  - Real bus topology: kernel exposes a device registry (item 2) that
    reports each device's parent (PCI slot, USB port, platform bus).
    libudev's `get_parent` walks that tree in userspace.
- **Blocking order**:
  1. Kernel: device registry (item 2).
  2. libudev: rewrite `get_parent` as a registry query.

---

## 13. gcc specs override for shared-library links

- **What**: `scripts/makaos-gcc-specs` patches `*startfile:` so `crt0.o`
  is skipped for `-shared` links.  Wired into
  `scripts/makaos-meson-cross.ini` via `c_link_args`/`cpp_link_args`.
- **Where**: `scripts/makaos-gcc-specs`, `scripts/makaos-meson-cross.ini`.
- **Scale failure**:
  - Not a scale issue, a toolchain correctness issue.  The cross-toolchain
    config sets `STARTFILE_SPEC = "crt0.o%s"` unconditionally instead of
    `%{!shared: crt0.o%s}`.  Every shared-library port must remember to
    inherit this specs file; meson ports get it automatically via the
    cross-file, but hand-rolled builds that bypass meson will miss it.
- **Target**:
  - Fix the cross-toolchain source config at build time: edit
    `gcc/config/i386/makaos.h` (or wherever the spec is defined) to use
    `%{!shared: crt0.o%s}`, rebuild the toolchain, delete the specs file +
    cross-file references.
- **Blocking order**:
  - Independent.  Do at next toolchain rebuild cycle.

## Guarantee

No entry in this ledger may move to "deferred forever."  Each is tied to a
tier or milestone:

- **Pre-Hyprland-launch (Tier 6)**: item 3 (real SO_PEERCRED).  Compositors
  need it to authenticate Wayland clients.  (The previous per-device evdev
  entry resolved 2026-04-21 when the multi-device input_device_t kernel
  rewrite landed — that's why the list skips from 2 to 3.)
- **Pre-SDL3/curl (Tier 7)**: items 4, 9 (msync, flock, fcntl record
  locks).  SDL and curl use these for file I/O correctness.
- **Pre-Ladybird (Tier 8)**: items 1, 2, 12 (libseat with revoke, libudev
  with hot-plug, real parent-chain topology).  Ladybird spawns many child
  processes with distinct UIDs per SECURITY_V2.md; input-heavy apps hit
  the parent-chain limitation.
- **Independent / opportunistic**: items 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 — fix
  when a concrete port or benchmark forces it.

Each stub carries a `// TODO(scalability-debt-ledger-#N)` comment pointing
back to its entry here.  When the entry is resolved, both the comment and
the ledger entry go.

## virtio-input: single-device binding
`kernel/drivers/input/virtio_input.c` binds only the FIRST virtio-input
PCI function (today's topology: one `virtio-tablet-pci`).  Scalable
replacement: loop the PCI scan, hold per-device state (queues, evdev
handle, MSI-X vector per device) in a kmalloc'd array — mechanical, no
design change.  evdev/devfs/udev-stub rows for event3+ go in
`kernel/fs/virtfs.c` + `scripts/port-libudev.sh` alongside.

## Boot self-tests: latent kthread-exit corruption — RESOLVED (2026-06-22)
The boot battery (chaselev/slab/typesafe/... in kernel/main.c) is behind
`#ifdef MAKAOS_BOOT_SELFTESTS` (off by default to keep normal boot fast; enable
with `SELFTESTS=1 bash build.sh`).  It used to intermittently DEADLOCK: a
self-test worker kthread exited with a RUNTIME-corrupted `cleartid_addr`
(e.g. 0x53004300530000, non-canonical) → `task_notify_cleartid`'s
`copy_to_user` #GP → that CPU wedged in the fault handler → a peer's
`synchronize_rcu` spun forever.

ROOT CAUSE (found): the PMM per-CPU page cache `pcp_drain_all()` claimed a
remote CPU's stash with plain reads/writes while the owner popped via
cmpxchg16b, so the same physical frame was handed to two owners — one of them
the task slab, which is how a kthread's `cleartid_addr` got scribbled with
another allocation's bytes.  FIXED in `mm/pcp` (commit 809127d): read-then-
cmpxchg16b-claim drain (see `cmpxchg16b_abs`).  The `_access_ok`/user-copy
hardening (iter2-3) had already made the resulting #GP non-fatal; this fix
removes the corruption itself.

VERIFIED 2026-06-22 (`SELFTESTS=1 bash build.sh`, headless boot): the FULL
battery PASSES — chaselev (0 duplicates), slab_test (200k allocs, hit rate
9999/10000, no crash), pmm10-test (all 8 order=10 allocs DISTINCT, the
double-alloc detector), typesafe/dcache/io_uring/eventfd/timerfd/socketpair/
scm_rights/signalfd/drm-mock — all PASS, with no `[pmm] DOUBLE-ALLOC`, no #GP,
no RCU stall.  Safe to enable by default if the boot-time cost is acceptable.

## execve in a multithreaded process: full POSIX leader-switch not done (F97)

F97 closed the cross-domain page-table UAF/LPE where a multithreaded exec freed
the old PML4 hierarchy while sibling THREAD_SHARE_MM threads still ran on it.
The fix (kernel/syscall/syscall.c, sys_exec): when g_current is NOT the sole
owner of its task_mm_t (refs > 1), it SIGKILLs the thread group, detaches
g_current onto a FRESH task_mm_t, and drops its ref on the old shared mm -- so
old_pml4 is freed by task_mm_release only when the last killed sibling exits
(no spin/deadlock, no UAF).  This is SECURITY-COMPLETE (the LPE is closed).

REMAINING (correctness, not safety): the full POSIX de_thread leader-switch is
NOT implemented.  g_current's tgid/leader identity is left unchanged.  For the
common case (the group LEADER calls execve) this is already correct -- g_current
stays its group's sole survivor with tgid == pid.  For the rare case where a
NON-leader thread calls execve, g_current keeps a tgid pointing at the (now
SIGKILL'd, soon-reaped) old leader, instead of becoming the new leader and
taking over the leader pid.  That is a benign residual (no UAF; the surviving
thread runs the new image), but POSIX would have the exec'ing thread assume the
leader identity.  The proper fix needs the tgid-index re-key + child-list /
waitpid reparenting (a de_thread).  This path is INERT at boot (every boot exec
is single-threaded, refs == 1), so it is untestable by the boot battery; the
[exec_mm] selftest covers the sole-owner-vs-shared decision threshold.

---

## pty: reopen /dev/pts/N after slave close while master open returns NULL (F104)

F104 closed the reopen-after-slave-close use-after-free: pty_slave_close now
clears pty->slave_file (and slave_claimed) when the master is still open, and
pty_open_slave_by_index uses vfs_tryget instead of a raw refcount bump.  So a
reopen of /dev/pts/N after the slave was fully closed (while the master stays
open) now returns NULL (a clean ENXIO-style failure) instead of resurrecting
the freed slave vfs_file_t.

REMAINING (functionality, not safety -- the UAF is fully closed): Linux devpts
lets a process reopen /dev/pts/N while the master is alive and get a fresh
slave handle.  MakaOS now rejects that reopen.  This does NOT affect the normal
terminal flow (the shell opens its slave once and keeps it open; dup/fork share
the same file via the refcount and an open-while-already-open succeeds through
vfs_tryget -- only a reopen AFTER a full close is rejected).  The proper fix is
to BUILD A FRESH slave vfs_file_t on demand in pty_open_slave_by_index when
slave_file==NULL && master_open (decoupling the slave file's lifetime from
per-open): extract a pty_make_slave_file(pty) helper used by both pty_alloc and
the reopen path, and set pty->slave_file before the s_pty_head insert in
pty_alloc so slave_file==NULL unambiguously means "closed" (no not-fully-built
window).  Deferred to keep this fix surgical on the boot-critical pty path; the
[pty_reopen] selftest pins the safety invariant (slave_file cleared, no UAF).

---

## io_uring: non-SQPOLL concurrent enter() can double-execute a SQE (F105)

F105 closed the io_uring SQ-consumer memory-safety bugs: enter() no longer
consumes a SQPOLL ring (the poller is the sole consumer), and
io_wq_ensure_worker is serialised so at most one async worker is ever spawned
(closing the orphaned-worker use-after-free for every consumer-race path).

REMAINING (correctness, NOT memory-safety -- no UAF/OOB): on a NON-SQPOLL ring,
two threads that share the ring fd and both call io_uring_enter concurrently
still run the SQ consumer loop unserialised (sys_io_uring_enter takes only
fdget/fdput), so they can read the same sq_head, dispatch the same SQE twice
(a double send/write/open) and double-advance the head.  This is io_uring
MISUSE (the ring is designed for a single submitter thread) and yields only a
duplicate operation + duplicate CQE, never memory corruption (the worker-orphan
UAF is already closed).  The proper fix mirrors Linux's uring_lock over
io_submit_sqes but WITHOUT holding a spinlock across a blocking sync dispatch
(IORING_OP_WRITE etc. block on disk I/O): claim one SQE under a per-ring
submit_lock (COPY it to a local to avoid the user-reuses-the-slot TOCTOU,
advance + publish sq_head), release the lock, then dispatch the copy outside it;
the IO_LINK chain logic must claim the whole chain under the lock.  Deferred to
keep F105 surgical on the boot-critical io_uring path; the memory-safety bugs
are fully closed.

## DRM: GEM handles are monotonic (never recycled), so the res3d array can grow with churn

Phase 2c unified each drm_file's GEM handle namespace onto one c->next_handle
counter (dumb + res3d) so a handle names exactly one object.  The counter is
monotonic: a create-then-destroy cycle never reuses a handle number.  Two
consequences, both bounded and neither a correctness bug:

1. find_res3d indexes an array by handle-1.  Because res3d handles now interleave
   with dumb handles (a render fd that PRIME-imports N dumbs then makes a res3d
   gets a res3d handle ~N), the array can be sparser than the live res3d count --
   res3d_cap tracks the max res3d HANDLE, not the live count.  For real workloads
   (Mesa render fd: mostly res3d + a handful of PRIME imports; compositor card
   fd: mostly dumbs + ~0 res3d) this is a few KB at most.

2. A long-lived fd that churns many res3d over its lifetime grows res3d_cap
   without bound (handles keep climbing).  This predates 2c -- the old
   next_res3d_handle was already monotonic.

The scalable fix is Linux's model: a single per-fd handle allocator with
recycling (idr / small hash keyed by handle) mapping handle -> {type, object},
replacing BOTH the dumb linked list and the res3d array.  Recycling needs a
generation tag to keep a stale userspace handle from aliasing a new object.
Deferred: handles are per-fd and bounded by that fd's lifetime allocation count;
no real client hits this, and the O(1) res3d lookup + unified-namespace
correctness are both preserved today.

## ext2/AHCI: filesystem metadata I/O runs under fs spinlocks via busy-polling

ext2's allocation and writeback paths hold spinlocks across block I/O:
alloc_inode / alloc_block hold the per-group s_group_locks[g] across the bitmap
read + bitmap/bgd write; the inode writeback holds the per-inode seqlock
write_lock across the 128-byte inode write.  This predates the scheduler change
that made spin_lock disable preemption (74c8dec): the code's comments call the
write_lock "preemptible" and were written when a writer could sleep inside
write_block.  After 74c8dec, sched_sleep panics with preempt_depth > 0, so the
AHCI IRQ-driven path (which sleeps on slot/submit/completion wait queues) can no
longer be called under those spinlocks -- open(O_CREAT) silently halted the CPU.

Fix in place (ahci.c AHCI_WAIT): the AHCI slot-alloc, submit-busy and completion
waits busy-poll (re-running ahci_rescan_completions each spin) when
preempt_depth > 0 instead of sched_sleep-ing.  This is correct -- the ISR still
fires with IRQs enabled and the rescan services completions directly -- but it
holds the fs spinlock AND disables preemption on that CPU for the whole I/O.  On
fast media (QEMU: microseconds) this is fine; on slow media a metadata write
under a group lock stalls the holding CPU and any CPU spinning on that group
lock for the I/O duration (~ms).

The scalable fix is to keep block I/O OUT of the fs allocation/inode spinlocks:
do the in-memory allocation decision under the lock (pin the bitmap/bgd/inode
blocks in bcache, set the bit / stage the inode in memory), release the lock,
then persist to disk with the normal sleeping path outside the lock.  Concurrent
allocators stay consistent via the pinned bcache block.  Deferred: the poll path
is correct and unblocks the whole Wayland-compositor bring-up (every compositor
creates a socket lockfile); no MakaOS workload issues enough concurrent
metadata writes for the lock-hold latency to matter yet.

## 14. virtio-gpu resource backing is physically contiguous (single mem_entry) -- RESOLVED (2026-07-11)

**RESOLVED.** DRM/virgl resource backing is now scatter-gather, not contiguous.
Every dumb, res3d, fb, PRIME clone and cursor backs its pages with a
`shmem_create_dma` object -- scattered (best-effort large blocks, degrading to
order-0, never requiring a contiguous span), pinned (DMA-safe + swap-immune),
fully resident -- and attaches to the device as a multi-entry mem_entry list
(`virtio_gpu_resource_attach_backing_sg`, chained-descriptor transport for any
run count).  Landed in: `shmem_create_dma` (d2a0467), the DRM conversion
(aba707a), and the cap/budget rework (this entry).  What changed vs the debt:

- **Fragmentation cliff: gone.** No resource needs a high-order contiguous block;
  a large buffer allocates as scattered pages even when RAM is fragmented.
- **Power-of-2 waste: gone.** `bytes_alloc` is now exact page-rounded, not
  rounded up to the next power-of-2 buddy order.
- **64 MiB per-resource cap: REMOVED.** It was purely a contiguity guard-rail (a
  buddy alloc that big fails under fragmentation); with scatter-gather there is no
  contiguous block to fail.  The only upper bound now is the backing store's
  capacity (`SHMEM_MAX_PAGES`, which also keeps `bytes` within uint32); the
  pinned-memory budget is the real guard.
- **Per-task 256 MiB magic cap: REPLACED** with two RAM-derived ceilings in
  `drm_charge` -- GLOBAL <= 3/4 of physical RAM (system-wide, keeps GPU memory
  from starving the kernel) and PER-TASK <= 1/2 of RAM (fairness), both floored so
  a small VM still runs a real GL workload, both enforced BEFORE any page is
  pinned so exceeding either is a clean `-ENOMEM`, never a crash.
- **STILL PLANNED (not a blocker):** a privileged raise-the-limit knob
  (sysctl/boot-param or ioctl) + per-client override, so a trusted compositor /
  GPU app that legitimately needs more can be granted it while the gate stays for
  untrusted clients (design captured in memory `project_makaos_gpu_pin_budget`).
  Also optional: 2 MiB huge-page userspace mmap for large runs (the allocator
  already clusters into 2 MiB-capable blocks; the mmap path currently installs
  4 KiB PTEs, zero-fault).

Verified headless (SELFTESTS=1): `shmem-dma` populate/pin + >64 MiB allocate,
`drm-budget` (>64 MiB charge OK + runaway reject + counters restored), the
virtio-gpu SG multi-entry round-trip, and the drm-mock vtable battery all PASS.

The original debt writeup, for history:

- **What**: every virgl/DRM resource (textures, render targets, window/scanout
  backing, vertex/staging buffers) is allocated with `pmm_buddy_alloc(order)` --
  a physically contiguous, power-of-2 block -- and attached to the device as a
  single `nr_entries=1` mem_entry via `virtio_gpu_resource_attach_backing_single`.
  The two memory ceilings the driver enforces are BOTH consequences of this one
  decision, not independent policy:
    - the **64 MiB per-resource cap** (`size64 > (64u << 20)` in
      `drm_ioctl_virtgpu_resource_create`), and
    - the **per-task charge ceiling** (`drm_per_task_limit()` in `drm_charge`,
      now `max(512 MiB, RAM/2)` -- was a fixed 256 MiB magic number).
  Neither ceiling reflects a device or hardware limit; each exists only to keep a
  client from asking the buddy allocator for a contiguous block large enough to
  exhaust or fragment physical RAM.
- **Where**: `kernel/drivers/video/drm.c` (`drm_ioctl_create_dumb`,
  `drm_ioctl_virtgpu_resource_create`, `drm_charge`/`drm_per_task_limit`),
  `kernel/drivers/video/virtio_gpu.c`
  (`virtio_gpu_resource_attach_backing_single`).
- **Scale failure**:
  - **Fragmentation cliff.** A 1080p BGRA window is ~8 MiB = order-11 = 2048
    contiguous pages. Fine at boot; after hours of churn high-order buddy blocks
    get scarce, so `pmm_buddy_alloc` returns ENOMEM even with plenty of free
    *scattered* memory. Windows are large and long-lived -- exactly the
    allocations most likely to fail.
  - **Power-of-2 internal waste.** A 5 MiB texture rounds up to an 8 MiB block:
    up to ~2x waste on every non-power-of-2 resource, and windows are rarely a
    clean power of two.
  - **Both memory caps are symptoms of the contiguity, not real limits.** The
    64 MiB per-resource cap and the per-task ceiling exist because high-order
    contiguous allocs are dangerous (fragmentation, ENOMEM-with-free-RAM), not
    because any resource or task needs them. A leak in the per-task charge is
    what crashed DarkPlaces in ~13 s (fixed in 34ad96b); making the ceiling
    RAM-proportional instead of a fixed 256 MiB reduces the blast radius, but
    the caps only truly *dissolve* under scatter-gather: scattered pages don't
    fragment the buddy allocator, so there is nothing to guard against and both
    numbers can go away.
  - Neither the guest nor the device requires physical contiguity: virtio-gpu's
    RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING is *built* for scatter-gather (an array of
    nr_entries {addr,length} mem_entries). Using one entry manufactures a
    contiguity requirement the hardware never imposes. What actually needs to be
    contiguous is *virtual* (the guest's single mmap of the resource + the HHDM
    kernel view), which page tables provide over scattered frames. Physical
    contiguity buys only simple pointer math.
- **Target**: allocate per-page (or a few large blocks), describe the backing to
  the device as a multi-entry scatter list (nr_entries > 1), map it
  virtually-contiguous into the userspace VMA and into a kernel window. Removes
  the fragmentation cliff, the power-of-2 waste, AND both artificial memory caps
  (per-resource 64 MiB and per-task) in one move -- once backing is scattered
  there is no contiguity to protect, so the ceilings can be dropped or raised to
  a pure fairness policy. Mirrors Linux GEM/GBM sg-list backing.
- **Blocking order**: needs (1) `virtio_gpu_resource_attach_backing` variant that
  emits an nr_entries>1 mem_entry array from a page list; (2) an mmap resolver
  (`drm_resolve_dumb_mmap`) that installs PTEs for a page list rather than one
  contiguous range; (3) a kernel virtually-contiguous mapping (vmap-style) for
  the HHDM-style readback path. Correctness is unaffected today (contiguous is a
  strict subset of what the device accepts); this is purely a scaling stopgap.
- **Note**: NOT the cause of the 2026-07 black-texture bug -- that backing is
  contiguous, correctly sized, and correctly attached; the 16x16 round-trip
  selftest proves the mechanism. Contiguity is a scaling problem, not a
  correctness one here.

## 15. libiconv is an identity-only stub (UTF-8/ASCII passthrough)

- **What**: the ported `iconv` (`userland/compat/linux/libiconv/iconv.c`, formerly
  heredoc'd in `scripts/port-libiconv.sh`) accepts only UTF-8/ASCII aliases and
  does a bounded `memcpy`; `iconv_open` returns EINVAL for any real charset.  No
  transcoding.
- **Where**: `userland/compat/linux/libiconv/`.
- **Scale failure**: any GLib/gettext consumer converting a non-UTF-8 charset
  (legacy locale data, some font/text pipelines, file names in other encodings)
  gets EINVAL or wrong bytes.  Fine while everything is UTF-8; breaks the moment a
  real conversion is needed.
- **Target**: a real charset-conversion primitive -- port GNU libiconv, or a
  shared MakaOS converter table -- exposed as the general Linux `iconv` surface.
- **Blocking order**: independent; do when a port needs non-UTF-8 conversion.

## 16. libdrm device enumeration is a synthesized single device

- **What**: `scripts/port-libdrm.sh` Python-patches `drmGetDevice2` /
  `drmGetDevices2` / `drmGetDeviceFromDevId` to return ONE hardcoded virtio-gpu
  device (PCI `0x1af4:0x1050`, bus `0000:00:04.0`, nodes card0 + renderD128)
  instead of enumerating real devices.
- **Where**: `scripts/port-libdrm.sh` (the `makaos_synth_virtio_device` patch).
- **Scale failure**: multi-GPU (iGPU + dGPU), a different PCI slot, or any
  non-virtio DRM device is invisible; the PCI IDs are wrong for real hardware.
  Mesa/libdrm see exactly one fixed device.
- **Target**: real enumeration via the **same kernel device registry as #2
  (libudev)** -- both want "list the devices + their bus topology + IDs".  libdrm
  becomes a thin client of that registry.
- **Blocking order**: kernel device registry (shared with #2), then rewrite the
  three enumerators as registry queries instead of a synth patch.

## 17. mprotect is a no-op stub (no SYS_MPROTECT)

- **What**: `userland/libc/jdk_compat.c`'s `mprotect()` returns success without
  changing any page permissions -- MakaOS has no user-facing mprotect syscall.
- **Where**: `userland/libc/jdk_compat.c`; the VMM already has the perm-tightening
  + TLB-shootdown machinery (see `kernel/mm/tlb.h`), just no syscall entry.
- **Scale failure**: guard pages (stack-overflow detection), W^X for JITs, and any
  runtime that relies on `PROT_NONE`/`PROT_READ` transitions silently keep their
  original permissions. The JVM's StackOverflowError guard page is inert.
- **Target**: add `SYS_MPROTECT` wired into the VMM (change VMA perms + shoot down
  the TLB), then make libc `mprotect` a thin syscall wrapper.
- **Blocking order**: independent; do when a runtime needs real page protection.

## 18. Only 32 signals; realtime signals (32-63) are accepted-but-undeliverable

- **What**: `NSIG` is 32 and the per-task `pending`/`blocked` masks are `uint32_t`,
  so signals 32-63 (the POSIX realtime range `SIGRTMIN..SIGRTMAX`) cannot be
  delivered. `sys_sigaction`/`sys_kill` accept them as benign no-ops so glibc-style
  callers do not treat the failure as fatal (see `SIGRTMAX_COMPAT`).
- **Where**: `kernel/proc/signal.h` (`NSIG`, `sigstate_t.pending/blocked`),
  `kernel/syscall/syscall.c` (`sys_sigaction`, `sys_kill`).
- **Scale failure**: RT signals never fire. OpenJDK's `sun.nio.ch.NativeThread`
  installs its blocking-I/O interrupt on `SIGRTMAX-2`, so `Thread.interrupt()` of a
  thread blocked in a native NIO call is a no-op; any app using `SIGRTMIN+n` for
  queued/realtime notification gets nothing.
- **Target**: widen the signal masks to `uint64_t` and `NSIG` to 64, then deliver
  32-63 like standard signals (every `1u << (sig-1)` becomes `1ull << ...`).
- **Blocking order**: independent; touches the signal-delivery core, so pair with
  a sigtest extension that exercises a signal >= 32.
